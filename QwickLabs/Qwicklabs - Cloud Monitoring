#: Cloud Monitoring: Qwik Start

Cloud Monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. Cloud monitoring
collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a 
variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and many others. Cloud monitoring 
ingests that data and generates insights via dashboards, charts, and alerts. Cloud monitoring alerting helps you collaborate by integrating 
with Slack, PagerDuty, HipChat, Campfire, and more.

Install the Monitoring and Logging agents

Agents collect data and then send or stream info to Cloud Monitoring in the Console.

The Cloud Monitoring agent is a "collectd-based" daemon that gathers system and application metrics from virtual machine instances and sends them to Monitoring. By default, the Monitoring agent collects disk, CPU, network, and process metrics. Configuring the Monitoring agent allows third-party applications to get the full list of agent metrics. Learn more.

The Cloud Logging agent streams logs from your VM instances and from selected third-party software packages to Cloud Logging. It is a best practice to run the Cloud Logging agent on all your VM instances. Learn more.

Uptime checks verify that a resource is always accessible. For practice, create an uptime check to verify your VM is up.
Use Cloud monitoring to create one or more alerting policies.
